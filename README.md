Sync Files like Workflows Between Repositories with GitHub Actions.

</div>

## üöÄ Features

- sync GitHub Actions workflow files to multiple repositories
- sync any file or directory to as many reposiories you want
- create a Pull Request in the target repo so you have the last say on what gets merged
- automatically label Pull Requests to integrate with other actions like [automerge-action](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action)
- assign users to the Pull Request

## üëã Introduction

With [action-github-file-sync](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/action-github-file-sync) you can sync files, like workflow `.yml` files, configuration files or whole directories between repositories. [action-github-file-sync](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/action-github-file-sync) works by running a GitHub Action in your master repository everytime you push something to that repo. The action will use a `sync.yml` config file to figure out which files it should sync where. If it finds a file which is out of sync it will open a pull request in the target repository with the changes.

## üìö Usage

Create a `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` folder (you can find more info about the structure in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)):

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
name: Sync Files
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run GitHub File Sync
        uses: BetaHuhn/action-github-file-sync@master
        with:
          GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```

In order to for the Action to access your repositories you have specify a [Personal Access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) as the value for `GH_PAT`.

> **Note:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not work

It is recommneded to set the token as a
[Repository Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

The last step is to create a `.yml` file in the `.github` folder of your repository and specify what file(s) to sync to which repositories:

`.github/sync.yml`

```yml
user/repository:
  - .github/workflows/test.yml
  - .github/workflows/lint.yml

user/repository2:
  - source: workflows/stale.yml
    dest: .github/workflows/stale.yml
```

More info on how to specify what files to sync where [below](#-Configuration).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Action Configuration

Here are all the parameters [action-github-file-sync](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/action-github-file-sync) takes:

```yml
CONFIG_PATH: The path to the sync configuration file
PR_LABELS: Labels which will be added to the pull request. Defaults to sync. Set to false to turn off
ASSIGNEES: People to assign to the pull request. Defaults to none
COMMIT_PREFIX: Prefix for commit message and pull request title. Defaults to üîÑ
COMMIT_EACH_FILE: Commit each file seperately. Defaults to true
GIT_EMAIL: The e-mail address used to commit the synced files. Defaults to the email of the GitHub PAT
GIT_USERNAME: The username used to commit the synced files. Defaults to the username of the GitHub PAT
TMP_DIR: The working directory where all sync operations will be done. Defaults to `tmp-${ Date.now().toString() }`
DRY_RUN: Run everything except that nothing will be pushed.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Sync Configuration

In order to tell [action-github-file-sync](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/action-github-file-sync) what files to sync where, you have to create a `sync.yml` in the `.github` folder of your master repository (see [action-configuration](#-action-configuration) on how to change the location).

The top-level key should be used to specify the target repository in the format `username`/`repository-name`@`branch`, after that you can list all the files you want to sync to that individual repository:

```yml
user/repo:
  - path/to/file.txt
user/repo2@develop:
  - path/to/file2.txt
```

There are multiple ways to specify which files to sync to each individual repository.

### List individual file(s)

The easiest way to sync files is the list them on a new line for each repository:

```yml
user/repo:
  - .github/workflows/build.yml
  - LICENSE
  - .gitignore
```

### Different destination path/filename(s)

Using the `dest` option you can specify a destination path in the target repo and/or change the filename for each source file:

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: workflows/build.yml
    dest: .github/workflows/build.yml
  - source: LICENSE.md
    dest: LICENSE
```

### Sync entire directories

You can also specify entire directories to sync:

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: workflows/
    dest: .github/workflows/
```

### Don't replace existing file(s)

By default if a file already exists in the target repository, it will be replaced. You can change this behaviour by setting the `replace` option to `false`:

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: .github/workflows/lint.yml
    replace: false
```

### Sync the same files to multiple repositories

Instead of repeating yourself listing the same files for multiple repositories, you can create a group:

```yml
group:
  repos: |
    user/repo
    user/repo1
  files: 
    - source: workflows/build.yml
      dest: .github/workflows/build.yml
    - source: LICENSE.md
      dest: LICENSE
```
